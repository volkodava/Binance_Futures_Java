        "\n",
        "This notebook serves as the starting point for using the YOLO11 model with [SAHI (Slicing Aided Hyper Inference)](https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/sahi-tiled-inference/).\n",
        "\n",
        "### What is Sliced Inference?\n",
        "\n",
        "Sliced Inference refers to the practice of subdividing a large or high-resolution image into smaller segments (slices), conducting object detection on these slices, and then recompiling the slices to reconstruct the object locations on the original image. This technique is invaluable in scenarios where computational resources are limited or when working with extremely high-resolution images that could otherwise lead to memory issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Benefits of Sliced Inference\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Reduced Computational Burden**: Smaller image slices are faster to process, and they consume less memory, enabling smoother operation on lower-end hardware.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Preserved Detection Quality**: Since each slice is treated independently, there is no reduction in the quality of object detection, provided the slices are large enough to capture the objects of interest.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Enhanced Scalability**: The technique allows for object detection to be more easily scaled across different sizes and resolutions of images, making it ideal for a wide range of applications from satellite imagery to medical diagnostics."
